so three iterations, i,j and k and making sure they dont equal to each other 

do a set so the numbers are unique from each other and doesnt repeat

make a empty list name is res 

sort the numbers from least to greatest that way we simplify finding unique triplets

making sure when i goes to the next number meaning when i > 0 so its on index 1 now and make sure a the value there is the value we just passed 

on index 0 

then its just two sum, we take a pointer at i + 1 so wherever i is the pointer will be one up of it i + 1 so thats the left pointer and the right pointer will be 

all the way to the end thats the right pointer its len(nums) - 1

then if the sum we get is greater than 0 decrease right pointer by 1, if its too less increase left pointer by 1 

if nothing needs to be changed thats the else statement then get the sum of all the values and add it to the res 

update the left pointer by l + 1 do a while loop for if the left pointer is on a number in the array adn the number before it is 

the same and left pointer is still below right pointer skip over it go the next one
