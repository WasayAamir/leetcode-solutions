check n the size of it? check the range as they have to be [0,n]

count from 0 all the way to n and check if the list contains every numbers from 0 to that n 

example if the list is from [0,5] we run a loop and check if every number in the list exists like 1,2,3,4,5 (inclusive) 

sort the array and iterate through it as we expect it to see the number in the array, [0,1,2,3] that is sorted when we iterate and it doesnt catch the "2" in the array

it will return that number as the missing number 

sorting it is good because the indices and the value are ALWAYS THE SAME as the range starts from [0,n] and indices start from 0 as well

so when sorted indices and value should be the same number
